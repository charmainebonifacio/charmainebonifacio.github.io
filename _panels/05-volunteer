	<p>I volunteer.</p>
</header>
<p>I am a life-long volunteer. My journey started quite late, when I was already in the university. I felt compelled to give back to the community in any way I can. For a full list of all 
my volunteer work, please check my <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/charmainebonifacio" class="icon fa-linkedin">LinkedIN</a> profile under the Volunteer section.
</p>
<p>With my involvement with various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to work on various projects, manage websites and social media platforms.
	For instance, Iâ€™ve mapped where the recipient schools in the Philippines for <a href="www.readworldfoundation.org">ReadWorld Foundation</a>, managed data and
	used data analytics visualisation for <a href="www.d42tm.org">District 42 Toastmasters</a> and <a href="https://3673.toastmastersclubs.org/">Coulee Commentators </a>,
	designed and created <a href='https://www.liffs.org/'>Lethbridge International Film Festival</a> websites, the <a href='http://www.readworldfoundation.org'>ReadWorld
	Foundation</a>. and <a href="www.glendabonifacio.com">Dr. Glenda Bonifacio</a>'s academic website.
