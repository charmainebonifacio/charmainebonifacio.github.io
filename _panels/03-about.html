	<h2>About</h2>
</header>
<p>Hello, I'm Charmaine Bonifacio. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Geography with a concentration in Geographical
	Information Science (GIS) at the University of Lethbridge in 2013. I also completed a two-year Cooperative Education as
	part of my undergraduate degree. </p>
<p>I completed my Master of Science degree in Geography under Dr. Stefan Kienzle and his Hydrology/GIS/Modelling lab team
	at the University of Lethbridge in 2016. My research interest focused on modelling the impact of climate change in the
	Oldman Reservoir Watershed by coupling an agro-hydrological model with regional climate change scenarios.
For a copy of my thesis, please check the University of Lethbridge <a href='https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/4781'>
	institutional repository</a>.</p>
<p>After emigrating from the Philippines in 2000, I lived in New South Wales, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area along
	with my family. I currently live in Lethbridge, Alberta where I currently work. For the last 5 years, I have been actively
	involved in various student and community organizations around Lethbridge. </p>
