	<h2>About</h2>
</header>
<p>Hello, I'm Charmaine Bonifacio. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Geography with
	a concentration in Geographical Information Science (GIS) at the University of Lethbridge in 2013.
	I also completed a two-year Cooperative Education as part of my undergraduate degree with the Calgary Airport Authority.
	As part of a course project, I was able to develop and publish <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>The
	Canadian Climate Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> with Dr. Chris Hugenholtz and Dr. Stefan Kienzle.
</p>
<p>I completed my Master of Science degree in Geography under <a href='http://people.uleth.ca/~stefan.kienzle/'>Dr. Stefan Kienzle</a>
	and his Hydrology/GIS/Modelling lab team at the University of Lethbridge in 2016. My research interest focused on modelling
	the impact of climate change in the Oldman Reservoir Watershed by coupling an agro-hydrological model with regional climate
	change scenarios. In addition, I focused on the rigorous testing of the Agricultural Research Catchments Unit (ACRU) model
	using the <a href='http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626668609491024'>Kleme≈°</a> hierarchical testing scheme for
	hydrological models. For a copy of my thesis, please check the University of Lethbridge <a href='https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/4781'>
	institutional repository</a>.</p>
<p>I have had the priviledge of being an <a href='https://abby-net.org/'>ABBY-NET</a> summer school student in 2013 and 2014. </p>
<p>After emigrating from the Philippines in 2000, I lived in New South Wales, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area along
	with my family in 2003. My family moved to southern Alberta in 2005, and have called it home ever since. I currently live
	and work in Lethbridge, Alberta. </p>
<p>Since 2012, I have been actively involved in various student and community organizations around campus and
	the community in Lethbridge. For a detailed list of work and volunteer experience, please kindly check out
	my <a href='https://ca.linkedin.com/in/charmainebonifacio'>LinkedIn</a> page. Thank you.</p>
