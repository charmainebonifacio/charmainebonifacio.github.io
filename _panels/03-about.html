	<h2>About</h2>
</header>
<p>Hello, I'm Charmaine Bonifacio. I received my Bachelor of Science (with Cooperatove Educatiion) degree in Geography with
	a concentration in Geographical Information Science (GIS) at the University of Lethbridge in 2013.
	I also completed a two-year Cooperative Education as part of my undergraduate degree. </p>
<p>I completed my Master of Science degree in Geography under <a href='http://people.uleth.ca/~stefan.kienzle/'>Dr. Stefan Kienzle</a>
	and his Hydrology/GIS/Modelling lab team at the University of Lethbridge in 2016. My research interest focused on modelling
	the impact of climate change in the Oldman Reservoir Watershed by coupling an agro-hydrological model with regional climate
	change scenarios. In addition, I focused on the rigorous testing of the Agricultural Research Catchments Unit (ACRU) model
	using the <a href='http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626668609491024'>Kleme≈°</a> hierarchical testing scheme for
	hydrological models.
For a copy of my thesis, please check the University of Lethbridge <a href='https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/4781'>
	institutional repository</a>.</p>
<p>After emigrating from the Philippines in 2000, I lived in New South Wales, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area along
	with my family. I currently live in Lethbridge, Alberta with my two dogs, Charly and Niro. For the last 5 years, I have been
	actively involved in various student and community organizations around Lethbridge. </p>
