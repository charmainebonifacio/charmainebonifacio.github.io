	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p> I code, create maps and dabble with websites. </p>
</header>
<p>I have always been fascinated with code. If I don't know it, I'll find a way to figure it out. There's always more that can be learned. Code can be optimised for efficient processing. </p>
<p>I have created maps for various publications: thesis and articles included. It's one way to showcase cartographic skills whilst being creative.</p>
<p>With various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to help lower costs by creating websites that are simple and work for the organization. I recently designed the Lethbridge International Film Festival <a href='www.liffs.org'>website</a>.</p>
