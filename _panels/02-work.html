	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>I code, run models, make maps, design and setup websites.</p>

<p>I am a life-long learner and self-taught when it comes to programming languages, which include R, Python, C#, FORTRAN, SQL,
	Shell scripting, VB.Net and VBA to name a few. While in university, I created and published <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>
		The Canadian Climate Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> to help helping researchers collect data from Environment Canada in a more efficient manner.
		I've been creating simple tools used to automate procedures, which means more efficient data processing and analysis, while
		reducing errors.

<p>Currently: Modelling and Data Analyst for Government of Alberta (GOA), Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. I currently work
	with irrigation, flow measurement, climate, crop, spatial, land use, and other data used in irrigation demand modelling using
	Irrigation Demand Model (IDM3), ArcGIS, SQL Server Management, DDIT and Water Information Systems by Kisters (WISKI). I maintain
	and integrate database with automated tools, scripts and applications that allows faster, more efficient data manipulation, analysis
	and interpretation. I lead the project to re-brand the <a href='https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/c0ca47b0-231d-4560-a631-fc11a148244e/resource/812527bc-acad-4a67-94ef-cbd21b251110/download/af-alberta-irrigation-information-2018.pdf'>
	2018 Alberta Irrigation Information</a> using R to utilise beautiful graphics.I also utilized R in reporting the analysis and
	data visualisation of 27 reservoirs within the South Saskatchewan River Basin in Alberta. I also developed an SQL Query Extractor application
	based in C# that is integrated with SQL Server Management application. I worked as a Modeller and GIS Analyst for MacDonald Hydrology
	Consulting Ltd using Raven and OSTRICH for hydrological modelling and utilising R data analysis and visualization.

<p>Creating maps is a creative outlet. I have been creating maps for various publications, including theses and journal articles. For a sample,
	please check out <a href='https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/c0ca47b0-231d-4560-a631-fc11a148244e/resource/812527bc-acad-4a67-94ef-cbd21b251110/download/af-alberta-irrigation-information-2018.pdf'>

<p>With my involvement with various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to work on various projects, manage websites and social media platforms.
	For instance, Iâ€™ve mapped where the recipient schools in the Philippines for <a href="www.readworldfoundation.org">ReadWorld Foundation</a>, managed data and
	used data analytics visualisation for <a href="www.d42tm.org">District 42 Toastmasters</a> and <a href="https://3673.toastmastersclubs.org/">Coulee Commentators </a>,
	designed and created <a href='https://www.liffs.org/'>Lethbridge International Film Festival</a> websites, the <a href='http://www.readworldfoundation.org'>ReadWorld
	Foundation</a>. and <a href="www.glendabonifacio.com">Dr. Glenda Bonifacio</a>'s academic website.
