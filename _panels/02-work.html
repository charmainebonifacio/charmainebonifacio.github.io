	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>I code, create maps and dabble with websites. </p>
</header>
<p>I have always been fascinated with code. It can be used to automate procedures,
	which means more efficient data processing and analysis, while reducing errors.
	Since 2014, I've been creating simple tools.</p>
<p>Creating maps is a creative outlet. I have been creating maps for various 
	publications, including thesis and journal articles.</p>
<p>With various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to help lower costs
	by creating websites that are simple and work for the organization.
	I recently designed the <a href='http://www.readworldfoundation.org'>ReadWorld Foundation</a>.
	I have also creative freedom to design and update the <a href='https://www.liffs.org/'>
		Lethbridge International Film Festival</a> website.</p>
