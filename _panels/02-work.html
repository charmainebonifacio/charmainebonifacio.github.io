	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>I manage data, code, run models, make maps, design and setup websites.</p>
</header>
<p>I am a life-long learner and self-taught when it comes to programming languages, which include R, Python, C#, FORTRAN, SQL,
	Shell scripting, VB.Net and VBA to name a few. While in university, I created and published <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>
		The Canadian Climate Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> to help researchers collect data from Environment Canada in a more efficient manner.
		I've been creating simple tools used to automate procedures, which means more efficient data processing and analysis, while
		reducing errors.
</p>
<p>Currently: Lead, Environmental Data Management for Elk Valley Resources (EVR) - formerly Teck Coal division. I am responsible for the management of EVR Environmental Management System using Earthsoft EQuIS database.
	I lead a highly technical staff in managing various environmental monitoring data for all the active mine sites and projects within EVR. I manage our team to help prioritize workload, identify risks,
	conduct annual reviews, and conduct annual objective planning.  My role is to ensure EVR can meet regulatory and corporate commitments and maintain the social license to operate. 
	My responsibilities include being a courageous safety leader; implementing and supporting an Environmental Data Quality Improvement Plan and the establishment data management standards, workflows, 
	and procedures to ensure the sustainability and integrity of the data management solutions. This includes leading the team to effectively manage, support, standardize data capture, reporting, audit data 
	collection and data quality of the EQuIS database system. I currently manage a user base of over 400 to help train, provide solutions, and operational support during upgrade and migration. It is my responsibility
	to engage and interact with software vendors (including labs) to help build out new software solutions for EVR. I will continue to support the existing implementation and seek future enhancements of the EQuIS database.
</p>
<p>Past Role: Environmental Data Analyst for Teck Coal under Sustainable Development group. In the last 3 years before stepping into a leadership role, I managed the environmental monitoring data for 
	TECK Coal by standardizing field data collection by implementing and developing EQuIS Collect program across operations and projects. I expanded feature updates on the Surfacewater template since 2021; 
	implemented and developed the Groundwater template since 2022. I provided techinical guidance in the development of addtional collect templates for the Aquatic Sciences. I saw an increase of user/group administration, 
	troubleshooting of Collect forms across the Elk Valley operations and projects. To overcome this challenge, I developed training materials and overview page for Collect users; additional training of Sample Planning Module users 
	for Program/Data Managers in order to pre-populate EQuIS Collect forms with all the sampling and field parameters. I also developed a tracker system using Microsoft Forms and PowerAutomate flow in order to keep track of ongoing 
	and increasing requests and issues related to the Collect program. This allowed me to discover recurring issues, trends and effectively resolve bug fixes with Earthsoft. Moreover, I assisted in importing, cleaning and 
	validating environmental data, as well as continuous data from various loggers, using a combination of VBA, Python and R for data wrangling, analysis and visualisation. I collaborate with various teams, 
	program managers and individuals to ensure governance with loading data into EQuIS. I also worked in multiple internal/external projects working with consultants to deal with massive data exports, 
	resulting in millions of records across the valley using ETL workbooks, updating SQL queries to fit the project. During the team's transition, I led the team's discussions on how to move forward using SWOT and 
	TOWS analysis. For the first time, the Teck Coal EQuiS team hosted the Earthsoft 2023 User Group Meeting in Calgary, where we presented the current challenges we've faced since its implementaion in 2013.

<p>Past: Modelling and Data Analyst for Government of Alberta (GOA), Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. I worked with irrigation, flow measurement, climate, crop, spatial, land use
	, and other data used in irrigation demand modelling using the Irrigation Demand Model (IDM3), ArcGIS, SQL Server Management, DDIT and Water Information Systems by Kisters (WISKI). I maintained
	and integrated the database with automated tools, scripts and applications that allowed for faster, more efficient data manipulation, analysis
	and interpretation. I lead the project to re-brand the <a href='https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/c0ca47b0-231d-4560-a631-fc11a148244e/resource/812527bc-acad-4a67-94ef-cbd21b251110/download/af-alberta-irrigation-information-2018.pdf'>
	2018 Alberta Irrigation Information</a> using R to utilise beautiful graphics.I also utilized R in reporting the analysis and
	data visualisation of 27 reservoirs within the South Saskatchewan River Basin in Alberta. I also developed an SQL Query Extractor application
	based in C# that is integrated with SQL Server Management application. I worked as a Modeller and GIS Analyst for MacDonald Hydrology
	Consulting Ltd using Raven and OSTRICH for hydrological modelling and utilising R data analysis and visualization.

<p>Creating maps is a creative outlet. I have been creating maps for various publications, including theses and journal articles. For a sample,
	please check out <a href='https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/c0ca47b0-231d-4560-a631-fc11a148244e/resource/812527bc-acad-4a67-94ef-cbd21b251110/download/af-alberta-irrigation-information-2018.pdf'>

<p>With my involvement with various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to work on various projects, manage websites and social media platforms.
	For instance, Iâ€™ve mapped where the recipient schools in the Philippines for <a href="www.readworldfoundation.org">ReadWorld Foundation</a>, managed data and
	used data analytics visualisation for <a href="www.d42tm.org">District 42 Toastmasters</a> and <a href="https://3673.toastmastersclubs.org/">Coulee Commentators </a>,
	designed and created <a href='https://www.liffs.org/'>Lethbridge International Film Festival</a> websites, the <a href='http://www.readworldfoundation.org'>ReadWorld
