	<p>I code, automate tools, create maps and dabble with websites. </p>
</header>
<p>I have always been fascinated with code. Since 2014, I've been creating simple tools. It can be used to automate procedures, which means more efficient data processing
	and analysis, while reducing errors. For instance, I created the <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>The Canadian Climate Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> with this in mind, helping 
	researchers collect data from Environment Canada in a more efficient manner.
</p>
<p>Creating maps is a creative outlet. I have been creating maps for various publications, including theses and journal articles. For a sample,
	please check out <a href='https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/c0ca47b0-231d-4560-a631-fc11a148244e/resource/812527bc-acad-4a67-94ef-cbd21b251110/download/af-alberta-irrigation-information-2018.pdf'>
	2018 Alberta Irrigation Information</a>, <a href='https://opus.uleth.ca/handle/10133/3496'>Amber Zary, MA</a>,
	<a href='https://opus.uleth.ca/handle/10133/4495'>Aimee Benoit, MA</a>, 
	<a href='http://directory.uleth.ca/users/johnston'>Dr. Tom Johnston</a>, 
	<a href='http://directory.uleth.ca/users/geoffrey.hale'>Dr. Geoffrey Hale</a>
</p>
<p>With various volunteer organizations, I've been fortunate enough to help lower costs
	by creating websites that are simple and work for the organization. For example, I helped developed
	the <a href='http://www.readworldfoundation.org'>ReadWorld Foundation</a>.
	I have also creative freedom to design and update the <a href='https://www.liffs.org/'>
	Lethbridge International Film Festival</a> website. Recently, I designed 
	<a href="www.glendabonifacio.com">Dr. Glenda Bonifacio</a>'s academic website
