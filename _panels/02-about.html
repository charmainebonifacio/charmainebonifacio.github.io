	<h2>About</h2>
</header>
<p>Hello, I'm Charmaine Bonifacio. I love to learn. I'm a self-taught coder. I love data, maps and volunteering.</p>
<p>I am a life-long learner and self-taught when it comes to programming languages, which include R, Python, C#, FORTRAN, SQL,
	Shell scripting, VB.Net and VBA to name a few. While in university, I created and published <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>
		The Canadian Climate Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> to help researchers collect data from Environment Canada in a more efficient manner.
		I've been creating simple tools used to automate procedures, which means more efficient data processing and analysis, while
		reducing errors.
</p>
<p>I completed my Master of Science degree in Geography under <a href='http://people.uleth.ca/~stefan.kienzle/'>Dr. Stefan Kienzle</a>
	and his Hydrology/GIS/Modelling lab team at the University of Lethbridge in 2016. My research interest focused on modelling
	the impact of climate change in the Oldman Reservoir Watershed by coupling an agro-hydrological model with regional climate
	change scenarios. In addition, I focused on the rigorous testing of the Agricultural Research Catchments Unit (ACRU) model
	using the <a href='http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626668609491024'>Klemeš</a> hierarchical testing scheme for
	hydrological models. For a copy of my thesis, please check the University of Lethbridge <a href='https://www.uleth.ca/dspace/handle/10133/4781'>
	institutional repository</a>.
</p>
<p>	I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Geography with
	a concentration in Geographical Information Science (GIS) at the University of Lethbridge in 2013.
	I also completed a two-year Cooperative Education as part of my undergraduate degree with the Calgary Airport Authority.
	As part of a course project, I was able to develop and publish <a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.10.010'>The
	Canadian Climate Data Scraping Tool (CCDST)</a> with Dr. Chris Hugenholtz and Dr. Stefan Kienzle. Please check
	<a href='https://uleth.academia.edu/charmainebonifacio'>Academia.Edu</a> or
	<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charmaine_Bonifacio'> Research Gate</a>
	for a copy of the journal article and the tool. During my time at the University of Lethbridge, I have had the priviledge of being
	an <a href='https://abby-net.org/'>ABBY-NET</a> summer school student in 2013 (Kananaskis, Alberta) and 2014 (Bavaria, Germany).
</p>
<p>I've recently been exploring MOOCS to supplement my learning and development, focusing on database development, mastering R and
	Python, data analytics and visualisation, working towards Data Science. I’m also working on upgrading my GIS knowledge by learning
	from ESRI Training free MOOCs, learning more about ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Online.
</p>
<p>I lived in New South Wales, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area along with my family after emigrating from the Philippines in 2000.
	My family moved to southern Alberta in 2005, and we have called it home ever since. Since 2012, I have been actively involved in various student and community organizations around campus and
	the community in Lethbridge. I currently live and work in Calgary, Alberta after a brief stay in the Elk Valley region. 

	Thank you.
